A very brief summary:

 - We are kind because of empathy. Empathy drives us to be kind.
 - We aren't kinder because our empathy is being switched off by empathy limiting mistakes.
 - Empathy limiting mistakes include missing knowledge, wrong assumptions, looking the other way...
 - By fully listening to people, while also giving them a safe space to share, we can switch on our innate empathy for them.
