title: '6.191: Computation Structures'
---

Broad overview of the class: How computers work internally (logic gates), followed by the paradigms used in computer hardware (combinational vs. sequential circuits), followed by semi-modern optimization techniques in software and hardware (compiler optimization, caching, some mention of modern design methods).

## Cheatsheets

- Part 3: I didn't make a cheatsheet for part 3. But broadly, we covered basic operating system stuff, how compilers optimize code, how to handle multithreading with semaphores, and how multicore processors handle multiple caches accessing a single main memory (with a bus line).
