title: '18.650: Fundamentals of Statistics'
---

We learned about the fundamentals of statistics :p

Really though, this was a fun class, I enjoyed it and learned a lot!

From the course catalog: A rapid introduction to the theoretical foundations of statistical methods that are useful in many applications. Covers a broad range of topics in a short amount of time with the goal of providing a rigorous and cohesive understanding of the modern statistical landscape. Mathematical language is used for intuition and basic derivations but not proofs. Main topics include: parametric estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, Bayesian inference, and linear and logistic regression. Additional topics include causal inference, nonparametric estimation, and classification.
